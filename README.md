# Kcal-O-metter
Kal-O-M’Otter is a mobile app for tracking calories and macronutrients, designed to make nutrition monitoring simple, motivating, and enjoyable. It replaces the “medical spreadsheet” feel with a fun experience, guided by a cute, expressive otter mascot that accompanies users and collects pebbles along the way.
